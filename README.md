# Introduction
The content in this repository includes articles, books, learning videos, and some practice scripts written in the process of learning PowerShell. By systematically recording the content of learning, I hope to deepen my understanding of various knowledge.

There are already many articles and tutorials about PowerShell on the Internet, but they are too scattered and the development of PowerShell is relatively fast, which makes many articles and tutorials unable to cover the latest development of PowerShell. So I decided to record what I learned.

It is recommended to treat this article as a study note or manual, not as a tutorial. It takes more time and energy to write tutorials, but I just want to spend the least time to master PowerShell, so I don't want to spend too much time on writing tutorials.
